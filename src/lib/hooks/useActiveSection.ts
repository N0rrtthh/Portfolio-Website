 * useActiveSection — which section the reader is currently in, plus the

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A HOOK
 * -------------------------
 * Classic and EVA each had their own copy of this, and each copy had the
 * same bug: one IntersectionObserver per section, every one of them calling
 * `setActive(itsOwnHref)` while it intersected a tall band. On most scroll
 * positions two sections satisfy that band at once, so the winner was
 * decided by the order the observer callbacks happened to fire — which is
 * neither document order nor "what is on screen". That is the navbar
 * highlighting the section above or below the one being read.
 *
 * A single reading line is deterministic: the active section is the last one
 * whose top has crossed a line 35% down the viewport. Exactly one section
 * can satisfy that at any scroll position, so there is nothing left to race.
 *
 * Everything runs in one rAF-throttled scroll pass — one listener for both
 * outputs, rather than a listener plus N observers.
