   MOTION SYSTEM — single source of truth for timing + easing
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Every animation in the portfolio pulls its duration and easing
   from here. That is what makes motion read as *authored* instead
   of a pile of one-off magic numbers.

   Rules of thumb used throughout:
     · exit is always faster than enter (user already decided)
     · UI feedback  → instant/fast
     · panels/modal → base with `out`
     · narrative reveals → reveal with `outExpo`
