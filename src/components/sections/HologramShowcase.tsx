       Points are sampled across the triangle SURFACE, area-weighted, at a

       Vertex sampling is why the cloud read as sparse dust: a mesh puts
       topology wherever the modeller needed it, so points bunched on
       detailed areas and left large flat panels nearly empty, and
       decimating by a stride made that worse. The object never resolved as
       a surface, so the deformation looked like noise instead of material
       tearing. Area-weighted sampling gives even coverage at whatever
       density we ask for, independent of the mesh's topology — and the

       behind it into a transmission target — so the point cloud and the
       card's grid bend through it. It stays `visible = false` until the
       freeze starts, so the transmission pass costs nothing in point mode.

       Freeze front:
       The shell reveals with the same radial front the points freeze on, so
       the two are one event: as a point crystallises, the solid appears in
       exactly its place. MeshPhysicalMaterial has no uniform for that, so
       the front is patched into its compiled shader — cheaper and far less
       fragile than reimplementing transmission by hand.

       The cut is dithered by a per-vertex hash rather than being a clean
       sphere, which is what sells it as crystal growth instead of a ball
       expanding. `discard` (not alpha) because the transmission pass reads

     · Range. ±1.2 world units is only the middle of the camera's view, so
       the line turned around well before the card's edges. It looked like
       a short line, but the travel was the bug — making the line taller
       would have masked it and clipped the caps.
     · Two useFrame callbacks each recomputed the phase, so a tab switch
       (which changes `offset`) could land them a frame apart.

   Now the phase is converted to a pixel position spanning the FULL canvas
   height (inset by the line's own half-height so its caps stay flush,
   never half-clipped by the card's overflow), and that exact same
   fraction is unprojected through the live camera onto the z = 0 plane
